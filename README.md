### Redragon K530 Draconic Mechanical Keyboard ###
 
 
 
As a budget mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Draconic provides a great entry point into the possibilities of the technology. This user manual was created with the entry-level user in mind, those who may not yet possess the necessary familiarity with the features and workings of a mechanical keyboard. As such, both the voice and content in this manual reflect a casual approach. For example, by referring to the keyboard as "your keyboard" rather than through a more formal and distant tone. Additionally, there are sections that go into detail regarding the removal and replacement of keycaps. This is a feature of the Draconic that was not explained in the original manual, despite providing the user with a set of keycap pullers and four mechanical switches. 

This user manual was written in Markdown, on the MarkdownPad2 client. One of this software's advantages is that it offers to write in Github Flavored Markdown, allowing for a simple transition of the files onto Github. The content was created following the 18F style guide, given the organisation's accessibility and clarity.
