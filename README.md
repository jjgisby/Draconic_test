### Redragon K530 Draconic 60% Compact RGB Wireless Mechanical Keyboard ###
 
This user manual was created with the entry-level user in mind, those who may not yet possess the necessary familiarity with the features and workings of a mechanical keyboard. As a budget mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Draconic provides a great entry point into the possibilities of the technology. As such, both the voice and content in this manual reflect a casual approach by referring, for example, to the keyboard as "your keyboard" rather than a more formal and distant tone. Additionally, there are sections that go into detail regarding the removal and replacement of keycaps. This is a feature of the Draconic that was not explained in the original manual, despite providing the user with a set of keycap pullers and four mechanical switches.
